Simulation and calculation data for a compact model of quasi-ballistic/ballistic p-type nanowire gate-all-around MOSFET
#
In this repository, we provide all the research data, including the NEGF simulation using SILVACO ATLAS, compact model calculation using Wolfram Mathematica, and result analysis using R and R Studio.
